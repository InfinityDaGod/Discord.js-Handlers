# Discord.js Handlers
I mainly made this repo for my self but why not make it public. I'll be putting some good discord.js handlers here. ( Temapltes for them )

You can find all the templates in the other branchs, every branch is named after that handler. so if you are looking for one you cah find it.

# Setup
- First run:
```
npm i wokcommands
```
- After that put your bot's token in `.env`.
- Type `node .` or `node index.js` to start it.

( Adding files soon )
